# Udacity_Starbucks_Capstone_Project

## Project Motivation

I selected to solve the problem of developing a model that predicts whether a customer will respond to an offer. There are two steps to my solution to this problem. First, I’ll combine the client profile, offer portfolio, and transaction data. The qualities of an offer, consumer demographic data, and whether the offer was successful will be described in each row of this integrated dataset. Second, I’ll evaluate the precision and F1-score of a naive model that assumes all offers are accepted. This gives me a starting point for analysing the performance of the models I build. The accuracy of a model is determined by how well it predicts whether or not an offer will be accepted.
